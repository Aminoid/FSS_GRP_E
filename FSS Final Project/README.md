In this project we worked on the problem of Multi-label and Multi-class text classification with Hyper parameter tuning. Methods such as
Differential Evolution and Randomized Search are used to tune hyper parameters.
We worked on two datasets:
1. 20NewsGroups dataset which comprises 18000 newsgroup posts on 20 topics. This is a multi-class dataset i.e. there are 
   multiple categories and every article belongs to a single category.
2. Reuters-21578 dataset which comprises 10788 news articles and 90 topical categories. This is a multi-label dataset i.e. 
   every article may belong to more than one category.
