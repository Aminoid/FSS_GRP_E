# Homework 1
This is **python** code for Homework 1.

[1]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lualure/src/master/data/POM3A.csv

## Problem Statement
Read each line, kill whitepsace and anything after comment characters (#), break each line on comma, read rows into a list of lists (one list per row), converting strings to numbers where appropriate. Note that some column headers contain ?: all such columns should be ignored. For now you can ignore the other magic characters in row1.

Your code should contain checks for bad lines (and bad lines should be skipped over); i.e. symbols where numbers should be and wrong number of cells (we will say that row1 has the “right” length).

## Setup
All the code is run on `python 2.7`.
Download the [POM3A.csv][1] file and keep it in this folder only.

## Running
File can be run using:

```python
python hw1.py
```
